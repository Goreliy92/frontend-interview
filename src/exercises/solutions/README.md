## When to Look at Solutions

- After you've attempted the exercise yourself
- When you're stuck and need a hint
- To compare your solution with alternative approaches

## Learning Tips

1. **Try first** - Always attempt the exercise before looking at the solution
2. **Understand, don't copy** - Read the solution to understand the approach
3. **Experiment** - Try different ways to solve the same problem
4. **Ask questions** - If something in the solution is unclear, ask your mentor
